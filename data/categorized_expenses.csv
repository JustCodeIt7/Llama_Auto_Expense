Additionally, the quantity is one pair of shoes, and the unit price is $349.99, which aligns more with personal luxury purchases rather than typical business expenses. Without further context indicating a clear business purpose or necessity for these specific dress shoes in carrying on the LLC's trade or business, they do not meet the IRS criteria of being both ordinary and necessary for a business deduction."

The quantity being one suggests personal ownership but does not preclude business use; high-end laptops are often used by professionals in various fields.

The terms used, such as 'Couples Retreat,' imply a focus on personal enjoyment or entertainment, which are typically non-deductible under IRS guidelines unless they can be directly tied to the active conduct of business (e.g., client meetings). Additionally, the single unit quantity and high price point ($1250) further suggest that this is not a bulk purchase for business operations but rather an individual luxury experience. Without additional context indicating a clear business purpose or necessity, such as meeting with clients or conducting significant business activities during the retreat, it defaults to non-deductible due to its personal nature."
